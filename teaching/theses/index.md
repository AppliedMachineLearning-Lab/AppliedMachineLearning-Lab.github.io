## How to apply

If you are interested in completing your bachelor’s or master’s thesis with our group, feel free to get in touch via `amllab[at]bit.uni-bonn.de` or contact the relevant researcher listed on our team webpage. Each researcher’s page includes their areas of interest. You can include your CV, transcript of records, and links to any relevant software projects you have worked on, if available.

## Procedure

Our lab follows several specific procedures when it comes to bachelor’s and master’s theses, namely:

- The master thesis usually takes about 6 months (it is planned for about 20-24 weeks)
- The working language of our group is English. That means, the meetings with the mentor and supervisor are usually in English, and the presentations to the team as well. Ideally, the work is also written in English, so that the students can also get regular feedback from the mentor while writing.

Furthermore, there is a fixed structure for meetings with the lab's members:
- **During the first meeting**, the student pitches their idea and receives feedback on its feasibility.
- **2–3 months later**: Progress meeting, including additional feedback and a brief progress report
- **Another 2–3 months later**: Final progress report.
- **After the thesis is submitted**: A defence date will be scheduled as soon as possible.

Additional meetings can be scheduled at the discretion of the mentor or supervisor.

## Topics

It is usually most effective to propose a topic that genuinely interests you, as this can help maintain motivation throughout the project. This approach also more closely resembles the way research is conducted in practice: while researchers often have guidance or general themes, they are generally expected to develop and refine their own research questions.

If you find it challenging to come up with a topic of your own, don’t worry. Below is a list of suggested topics that may serve as inspiration or a starting point. You are welcome to directly use these ideas, combine or adept them, or use them to help formulate your own research question in your thesis at our lab.
