# From Theory to Practice: Workshop on Large Language and Foundation Models

**Location**: Online  
**Conference**: [BigData 2025](https://conferences.cis.um.edu.mo/ieeebigdata2025) (IEEE International Conference on Big Data)  
**Date**: December 8-11, 2025 (exact date to be announced)

Large language and foundation models have rapidly emerged as pivotal technologies in data science and analytics, 
offering unprecedented capabilities in text generation, knowledge extraction, and complex decision-making. The third iteration of 
this workshop seeks to bridge cutting-edge theory with real-world applications, providing a venue for researchers and 
practitioners to exchange novel methodologies, deployment strategies, and impact-driven insights. By spot-lighting both 
breakthrough techniques and operational challenges, the workshop aims to foster cross-pollination of ideas, accelerate 
innovation, and elucidate pathways for seamless integration of large language models into diverse data-driven 
ecosystems.
